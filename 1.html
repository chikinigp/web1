<h2>Introducing ME</h2>
Hello this is Grace
<p>I want to become an
engineer, <strong>entrepreneur, <u>and</u> an advocate</strong>. Nice to meet yall</p>
<p>I'm very passionate about sports, vlogs, my ability, <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality" target="_blank" title="INTJ personality">personality</a>, and my skills in
various things. I love to play basketball, badminton, volleyball, soccer, and etc.
I don't do vlogs but I'm planning to do it soon after I know and learn how to code. I am
ardent about my ability because I think I am different than any other people on Earth.
I feel like I am the most special human who's ability is infinite. I love my personality
because although I am shy, I sometimes become loca and so something that I would never do
when I am sober. Even though it always end up as a 이불킥, I would do it again if I have to.
I am INTJ so I lack empathizing skills but I love others with all my heart.</p>
